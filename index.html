        <p>Mother nature has the best box of crayons. Nature never goes out of style. Gardeners are alchemists. They know how to turn crap into crops. A garden is a friend you can visit anytime. Never underestimate the healing power of a quiet moment in the garden. Anyone who has time for drama is not gardening enough. To plant a garden is to believe in tomorrow.

                One man's constant is another man's variable. They don't make bugs like Bunny anymore. It's not a bug - it's an undocumented feature. If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in. If something is worth doing once, it's worth building a tool to do it. Without requirements or design, programming is the art of adding bugs to an empty text file.</p>
